Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101.git
Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore. 
https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101/new/main
https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101/upload
https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101/new/main?readme=1
https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101/new/main?filename=LICENSE.md
https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101/new/main?filename=.gitignore


…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# web101" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101.git
git push -u origin main


…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/vintageashtray/web101.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
